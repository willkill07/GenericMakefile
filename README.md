GenericMakefile
===============

A truly generic makefile

typing in `make` will show you everything you need to know about your source tree

`make flags` will show you flags necessary for clang-complete and other utilities

To compile a directory tree, just type `make <executable>` where `executable` is the target name of your choosing

I welcome any bug reports or feature requests!
